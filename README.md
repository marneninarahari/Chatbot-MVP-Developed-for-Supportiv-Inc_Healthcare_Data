### The deatils of each step is provided below.

# Chatbot with Generative Pretrained Transformer(GPT) Model
#### The objective of this project is to develop a Chatbot using a pretrained text generation model (GPT-model) and go over the process of fine-tuning it on the given dataset. This fine-tuning step is key in producing highquality models. Fine-tuning allows us to adapt a model to a specific dataset or domain.

#### The supervised fine-tuning method which is a most common method for fine-tuning text generation models has been implimented. The transformative potential of finetuning pretrained text generation models is to make them more effective tools for the application.
