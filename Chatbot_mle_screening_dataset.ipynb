Generative models are used across many diverse use cases, making it a challenge to rely on a singular metric for judgment. Given their probabilistic nature, generative models do not necessarily generate consistent outputs. No one metric is perfect for all use cases.\n","\n","#### One common metrics category for comparing generative models is wordlevel evaluation. These classic techniques compare a reference dataset with the generated tokens on a token(set) level. Common word-level metrics include perplexity, ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore.\n","\n","#### A common method for evaluating generative models on language generation and understanding tasks is on well-known and public benchmarks, such as MMLU,GLUE, TruthfulQA, GSM8k, and HellaSwag. These benchmarks give us information about basic language understanding but also complex analytical answering.\n","\n","#### Aside from natural language tasks, some models specialize in other domains, like programming.

PPO is a popular reinforcement technique that optimizes the instruction-tuned LLM by making sure that the LLM does not deviate too much from the expected rewards.\n","\n","#### A disadvantage of PPO is that it is a complex method that needs to train at least two models, the reward model and the LLM, which can be more costly than perhaps necessary.\n","\n","#### Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an alternative to PPO and does away with the reinforcement-based learning procedure. Instead of using the reward model to judge the quality of a generation, we let the LLM itself do that. Compared to PPO, the DPO method is found to be more stable during training and more accurate.\n","\n","#### The combination of SFT+DPO is a great way to first fine-tune the model to perform basic chatting and then align its answers with human preference. However, it is computationally expensive since we need to perform two training loops and potentially tweak the parameters in two processes.\n","\n","#### Recently, a new method, called Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) of aligning preferences has developed by J Hong (2024). This method combines SFT and DPO into a single training process. It removes the need to perform two separate training loops, further simplifying the training process while allowing for the use of QLoRA."],"metadata":{"id":"mMMdVek3fUT5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Conclusion\n","\n","#### In project, I have developed a Chatbot (generative AI model) by fine-tuning pretrained LLM. I have used a lite weight pretrained LLM model \"\"Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct\" and fine-tuned on the given data set \"mle_screening_dataset.csv\". The fine-tuning was performed by making use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) through the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique and the LoRA was extended through quantization, a technique for reducing memory constraints when representing the parameters of the model and adapters. The model performance was tested with four different examples. Since I have used a lite weight pretarined model, there is a limitation on the number of characters in text generation.\n","\n","#### We can further improve the model by utilizing large medical-specialized LLMs such as BioGPT, MedAlpaca, or PMC-LLaMA. For deployment in healthcare (HIPAA-compliant), even we can use better models like Azure OpenAI GPT-4 or Google Med-PaLM 2. Additionally, we can run a RAG pipeline with trusted medical sources to get most accurate answers for the questions asked.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"o1e8hJj9npjq"}}]}
